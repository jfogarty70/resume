<h2 >Graphic Design and Project Management</h2>
<p>Thank you for taking a look at my site and learning more about me and my work. I was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where I received my degree in Visual Communications/Graphic Design and worked in the industry for over seventeen years. My experience varies from graphic design, print production, and web site design and project management. Throughout my professional management and design career I have successfully utilized my skill sets in print advertising, creative collaboration of sales and marketing collateral, web graphics, vinyl wrap production, various concepts of packaging design and much more. I am a driven and ambitious designer with focused attention to detail, excellent time management to meet tight deadlines and advanced technical and analytical skills.</p>

<p>My experience has allowed me to successfully manage multiple projects from initial planning phases to the final completion stages of projects, no matter the size of any project given. My goal is to provide superior client support and customer service throughout the job and to always ensure consistent customer contact with status updates and coordinated job changes. I maintain a high standard of quality control to ensure cost effectiveness and error-free productivity. My design services vary from logo design and branding to conceptualizing and designing marketing print collateral ranging from corporate identity packages, product brochures, newspaper and magazine ads, billboard advertising, point-of-purchase and trade show displays, outdoor signage, direct mailers, sales and marketing aids, branded event invitations and premium item artwork. In addition to traditional print work, I also offer design services involving multimedia design, including but not limited to, PowerPoint presentations, web graphics and web site designs indicative of existing or developed client branding.</p>

<p>I invite you to take a look at some samples of my previous work and look forward to serving any project management and design needs for you in the future. If you have any questions or would like information about any services I offer, please feel free to contact me directly or send a message through my “Contact” page. Thank you.</p>
